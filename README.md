# Dr.-Feel-Good1.0
(Unfinished) Dr. Feel Good is a web application that allows a user to insert how they feel into a textbox and receive an inspirational quote depending on the sentimental response given. The type of response is detected with machine learning using sentiment analysis; it detects if the response is positive or negative and sends out a quote to the user in accordance with the response given. The web application was developed in Wix and was intended to fetch the API created to execute the machine learning script coded in python. However, Wix didn't have the functionality to support this. Overall, the script works as intended.
